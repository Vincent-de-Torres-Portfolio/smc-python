Filename: guessing_game.py

This module simulates a guessing game where the player and the dealer (program) each guess a number. The goal is to be closest to the target number without going over. The player and dealer are randomly assigned colors (blue or yellow) for each game, and the banner theme color is based on who is leading.

Constants:
- DEFAULT_TARGET (int): The default target number to be guessed.
- LOWER_BOUND (int): The lower bound for guesses.
- UPPER_BOUND (int): The upper bound for guesses.

Functions:
- clear_screen(): Clears the terminal screen.
- print_message(message, color=ANSI_RESET): Prints a message with a border and optional color.
- welcome_message(): Displays the welcome message for the game.
- get_player_guess(): Prompts the player to enter a guess within the specified bounds.
- generate_dealer_guess(): Generates a random guess for the dealer.
- calculate_difference(target, guess): Calculates the difference between the target and a guess.
- determine_winner(player_guess, dealer_guess, target): Determines the winner based on the closest guess to the target.
- print_game_details(target, player_guess, player_difference, dealer_guess, dealer_difference, result, round_type, color): Prints the details of the game round.
- generate_target_number(): Generates a random target number between the lower and upper bounds.
- play_again(): Prompts the player to decide whether to play another round.
- print_lead(player_points, dealer_points, player_color, dealer_color): Prints the current lead based on points and returns the leading color.
- input_processor(): Processes the game logic, manages rounds, and tracks scores.
- main(): Executes the main game flow.
