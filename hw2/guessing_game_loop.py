Filename: guessing_game.py

This module simulates a guessing game where the player and the dealer (program) each guess a number. 
The goal is to be closest to the target number .


Constants:
- DEFAULT_TARGET (int): The default target number to be guessed.
- LOWER_BOUND (int): The lower bound for guesses.
- UPPER_BOUND (int): The upper bound for guesses.

Functions:
- clear_screen(): Clears the terminal screen.
- print_message(message, color=ANSI_RESET): Prints a message with a border and optional color.
- welcome_message(): Displays the welcome message for the game.
- get_player_guess(): Prompts the player to enter a guess within the specified bounds.
- generate_dealer_guess(): Generates a random guess for the dealer.
- calculate_difference(target, guess): Calculates the difference between the target and a guess.
- determine_winner(player_guess, dealer_guess, target): Determines the winner based on the closest guess to the target.
- print_game_details(target, player_guess, player_difference, dealer_guess, dealer_difference, result, round_type, color): Prints the details of the game round.
- generate_target_number(): Generates a random target number between the lower and upper bounds.
- play_again(): Prompts the player to decide whether to play another round.
- print_lead(player_points, dealer_points, player_color, dealer_color): Prints the current lead based on points and returns the leading color.
- input_processor(): Processes the game logic, manages rounds, and tracks scores.
- main(): Executes the main game flow.
